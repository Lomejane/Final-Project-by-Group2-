                        <p>A home is much more than the space where we sleep and store our belongings: it is a small universe of well-being where we relax and feel at ease, a unique place where we can take shelter from everyday life and its ups and downs. That’s why creating comfortable spaces is essential.</p>
                        <p>But a home should also respond to your lifestyle and be a vehicle of expression, adapting to the needs of your family and your personality. And this is where the “comfy house” concept comes into play.</p>

            <h5>The general recommendation is to organize the furniture so that you can easily move around the room. A good idea is to group the different pieces (sofa, armchairs, coffee tables, etc.) together to make conversation easier.

                When arranging the furniture in your home you should also check what proportion of furniture fits its dimensions and avoid combining pieces that are too large or too small to achieve a greater sense of balance.</h5>

                        <p>The living room or dining room is the center of any home, the space where we spend more time watching TV shows or chatting with friends and family. 

                            The sofa is usually the focal point of these gatherings and is a key piece for a comfortable home. To choose the best sofa you have to take these aspects into account: 
                            
                            Color.
                            Size.</p> <p>Number of people living in the house.
                                Time you usually spend on the sofa. 
                                Modular furniture is also an option to increase comfort and convenience in a home. Modular tables, simple and neutral, can become an alternative to take advantage, in a practical way, of a corner that needs a touch to come to life. The same goes for other auxiliary furniture such as trunks, chests of drawers or bureaus, which combine practicality with aesthetics.  </p>
